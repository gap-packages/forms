  and quadratic forms. The reader can find more in the texts: Cameron [Cam00],

  [33X[0;0YIn  this  chapter  we consider an [22Xn[122X-dimensional vector space [22XV[122X over a finite
  field.  Suppose that [22Xf[122X is a sesquilinear form or a quadratic form on [22XV[122X, then
  we call the pair [22X(V,f)[122X a [13Xformed vector space[113X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YOne  of  the objectives of studying maps between formed vector spaces is the
  classification  of  sesquilinear  forms  on  a  vector  space [22XV[122X, where it is
  sufficient  to classify non-degenerate forms. The following results are well
  known.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt can be proved that (see for example Section 6.3 of [Cam00]):[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yall  non-degenerate  alternating  forms of a given vector space over a
        given finite field are similar,[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yall  non-degenerate  hermitian  forms  of  a given vector space over a
        given finite field are similar, and,[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ythe  non-degenerate  symmetric bilinear forms on a vector space over a
        field  with  odd  characteristic  come in three flavours, two of which
        occur  when  the  dimension  of the vector space is even, one of which
        occurs when the dimension of the vector space is odd.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  principle,  within each similarity class, different isometry classes can
  occur,  but  we  will see that in most cases, each similarity class contains
  exactly one isometry class.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YGiven  a  sesquilinear  form  [22Xf[122X  over  a  vector  space  [22XV[122X,  [5XForms[105X  provides
  functionality   to   compute  the  linear  map  [22Xϕ[122X  from  [22XV[122X  to  itself  (or,
  equivalently,  a matrix describing a change of basis), such that [22Xf[122X is mapped
  to its canonical representative in its isometry class. In the next sections,
  we describe the representative(s) of the similarity class(es) used in [5XForms[105X,
  and,  when  necessary, the different isometry classes, for each of the three
  reflexive  sesquilinear  forms.  The  easiest  cases  are  the hermitian and
  alternating cases.[133X
  
  
  [1X5.1-1 [33X[0;0YHermitian forms[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  suppose  that  [22Xf[122X  is a non-degenerate hermitian form on a vector space [22XV[122X
  over  the  finite  field  [22XF[122X, with involutory field automorphism [22Xα[122X. It can be
  proved  (see  [KL90])  that  any vector space equipped with a non-degenerate
  hermitian  form  [22Xf[122X  contains  an orthogonal basis such that [22Xf(e_i,e_i)=1[122X for
  each  basisvector  [22Xe_i[122X.  Hence  [22X(V,f)[122X  is  isometric with [22X(V,f')[122X with [22Xf'[122X the
  non-degenerate  hermitian  form  with  the  identity matrix over [22XF[122X. The Witt
  index of [22Xf[122X equals [22Xn/2[122X when [22Xn[122X is even and [22X(n-1)/2[122X when [22Xn[122X is odd.[133X
  
  
  [1X5.1-2 [33X[0;0YAlternating forms[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  suppose that [22Xf[122X is a non-degenerate alternating bilinear form on a vector
  space  [22XV[122X  over  a  finite  field  [22XF[122X.  As  already  mentioned in Section [14X3.1[114X,
  non-degenerate  alternating  forms  only  exist  on  even dimensional vector
  spaces.  Restricting  to  a  two  dimensional  vector  space,  it  is  clear
  immediately that the Gram matrix of [22Xf[122X must be for some non-zero [22Xr ∈ F[122X. If we
  rescale one of the basisvectors, which induces an isometry, then we see that
  there  always exists a basis such that [22Xr=1[122X. We call a two dimensional vector
  space   equipped   with  a  non-degenerate  alternating  form  a  [13Xsymplectic
  hyperbolic  line[113X,  and  it  is  proved (see Theorem 6.7 of [Cam00]) that the
  formed  space [22X(V,f)[122X can be written as an orthogonal direct sum of symplectic
  hyperbolic  planes.  Hence, up to isometry, there is only one non-degenerate
  alternating  form  of  an  even  dimensional  vector space, and we choose as
  canonical representative the alternating form with Gram matrix[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe Witt index of [22Xf[122X equals [22Xn/2[122X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YWe  suppose  that  [22Xf[122X is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on a vector
  space  [22XV[122X  over  a  finite  field  [22XF[122X  with  odd characteristic. We call a two
  dimensional  vector space a [13Xhyperbolic line[113X if it contains a non-zero vector
  such that [22Xf(v,v) = 0[122X. It is proved (see Proposition 6.9 of [Cam00]) that any
  two   hyperbolic   lines   are   isometric,   and  we  choose  as  canonical
  representative the orthogonal form with Gram matrix[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  can  be proved (see Theorem 6.10 of [Cam00]) that the formed space [22X(V,f)[122X
  can  be  written  as  the  orthogonal direct sum of hyperbolic lines and one
  subspace  [22XU[122X  of  dimension at most two. The behaviour of [22Xf[122X on the subspace [22XU[122X
  determines the similarity class of [22Xf[122X. We describe the three occurring cases,
  to describe the chosen canonical form, we use the polynomial rather than the
  Gram matrix.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf the dimension of [22XU[122X is zero, then [22X(V,f)[122X is the orthogonal direct sum
        of  hyperbolic lines, and hence [22X(V,f)[122X is isometric to the formed space
        [22X(V,f')[122X,  where  the  Gram matrix of [22Xf'[122X consists of blocks as described
        above. The chosen canonical form has polynomial[133X

        [33X[0;6YNote  that the dimension of the vector space [22XV[122X is necessarily even. We
        call [22Xf[122X [13Xhyperbolic[113X (see also Section [14X3.1[114X). It follows also that in this
        similarity  class, there is only one isometry class. The Witt index of
        [22Xf[122X equals [22Xn/2[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  the  dimension  of  [22XU[122X is one, then necessarily the polynomial of [22Xf[122X

        call  [22Xf[122X  [13Xparabolic[113X  (see also Section [14X3.1[114X). It is clear that if [22Xμ[122X is a
        square in [22XF[122X, then rescaling the first basis vector yields a polynomial[133X

        [33X[0;6Ywhich  we choose as the canonical form for this similarity class. If [22Xμ[122X
        is a non-square, a rescaling of [22Xx_2,x_4,...,x_n-1[122X yields a polynomial[133X

  [33X[0;0YSuppose that [22Xf[122X is a degenerate sesquilinear form on the vector space [22XV[122X, then
  [22XRad(f)[122X  is  a non-trivial subspace of the vector space [22XV[122X. The vector space [22XV[122X
  can  be written as the orthogonal direct sum of a subspace [22XW[122X and [22XRad(f)[122X, and
  the restriction of [22Xf[122X to [22XW[122X is a non-degenerate sesquilinear form on [22XW[122X. Hence,
  [22Xf[122X is isometric with a sesquilinear form having Gram matrix[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Ywhere [22XM[122X is the Gram matrix of a non-degenerate sesquilinear form and [22XA,B[122X and
  [22XC[122X  are  appropriate  zero  matrices. As explained in Section [14X3.1[114X, the form [22Xf[122X
  induces  a  non-degenerate form [22Xg[122X on the vector space [22XV/Rad(f)[122X. The computed
  matrix  [22XM[122X  can be taken as Gram matrix for the form [22Xg[122X. As defined in Section
  [14X3.1[114X,  the  Witt  index  of  the  degenerate  form [22Xf[122X is the Witt index of the
  non-degenerate  inducedform  [22Xg[122X.  The  dimension  of  the  maximal  isotropic

  [33X[0;0YAlso  in  this  case,  one of the objectives of studying maps between formed

  [33X[0;0YSince  there  is  a  one-to-one  relationship between quadratic forms in odd
  characteristic  and  orthogonal  bilinear  forms  in  odd characteristic, we
  suppose  in  this section that [22Xf[122X is a quadratic form in even characteristic.
  We  call  a  two dimensional vector space a [13Xhyperbolic line[113X if it contains a
  non-zero  vector  such  that  [22Xf(v) = 0[122X. It is proved (see Proposition 6.9 of
  [Cam00])  that  any  two  hyperbolic  lines  are isometric, and we choose as
  canonical  representative  the quadratic form with polynomial [22Xx_1 x_2[122X. As in
  the  case  of  the  orthogonal bilinear forms, it can be proved (see Theorem
  6.10  of  [Cam00]) that [22X(V,f)[122X can be written as the orthogonal direct sum of
  hyperbolic  lines and one subspace [22XU[122X of dimension at most two. The behaviour
  of  [22Xf[122X  on  the  subspace  [22XU[122X  determines  the  similarity  class  of  [22Xf[122X.  The

  one in odd characteristic.[133X
